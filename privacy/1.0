This bot will take uploads of logs from you and process them to derive statistics.
On first upload your in game name will be read from logs and linked to your Discord ID.
This bot will link all this information to your discord id so you can retrieve it by command.
Beyond this bot having access to your logs, uploading files to the bot naturally means
that discord the company has a copy.

The bot will ...
    - Upload an archival copy of your log to a private channel accesible only by devs
    - Read through your log and select events of interest for statistics, i.e. kills, deaths, locations
    - Store parsed information in the bot's database on the server hosting the bots.
    - Store derived statistics from these events
    - The bot will store information about matches and outcomes.

This bot is not intended to spy. It is for entertainment and amusement.
Data collected and processed will not be shared with anyone.
Only the server owner and the dev team have access.

This is not a legal notice, the author is not a lawayer. If you have questions contact the devs.
This privacy statement may be updated as new features are added, the version will be incremented when it is.
